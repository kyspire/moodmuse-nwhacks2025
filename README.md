cd open-cv-playlist 

python3.9 -m venv nwhacks ~ in the open-cv-playlist folder, this creates a virtual environment 

source nwhacks/bin/activate ~ to activate, make 2 terminals. One for the frontend and one for backend. 

pip install -r requirements.txt ~ to install the requirements 

pip install deepface

pip install tf-keras
